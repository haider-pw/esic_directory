So what, your thinking clever me I've claimed $10k back and a have a tidy little CGT. exemption up my sleeve.<br /><br />Don't be so sure, particularly if your prone to take an option or 2 on the side.<br /><br />The legislation is quite ruthless when it comes to retail investors, 50k is it, one cent more and your entitlements are extinguished, including the CGT exemption.<br /><br />The 50k includes all ESIC's so you will have to consider all other investments made that year. Perhaps your $1 founder share in your own startup will push you over the threshold? perhaps another investment that you assess as non eligible is assessed by others as an ESIC and the ATO agree.<br /><br />You can be sure that 20:20 hindsight will catch wary and unwary advisors off guard, and perhaps our directory or updates could help you avoid a nasty audit surprise!<br /><br />May 50,000 blessings be upon you,<br /><br />Tom</div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pro's and Con's]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/pros-and-cons]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/pros-and-cons#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 02:02:38 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/pros-and-cons</guid><description><![CDATA[We all have a rich uncle or inlaw and in my case his name is Con, he's a successful business man and a wealth of knowledge contacts and experiance, given the chance I run pretty much every important decision regarding money by him.Con's got my best interests and future in mind so I'm lucky, he's also a s708 exempt investor, which basically means he is wealthy and his accountant says so.

It also means he gets the 200k ESIC rebate not the $10k normal retail investors get (all things equal).<br /><br />Con's been good enough to let me 'in on' a few of his investments and by and large I can't complain.<br /><br />So what's the point, well it's unsefull to note that Con and I used an trust structure for our investments, better asset protection, planning and flexibility. Well now we are looking at ESIC's we'll probably use that vehicle as well.<br /><br />So what gives? The 200k or the 10k threshold? And what happens when you are investing in a less family way?<br /><br />We looked it up, and it seems that Con as trustee sets the rule, i.e. He's exempt to the trust gets a 200k rebate threshold, which is a relief as I'd be out of the loop otherwise!<br /><br />The moral or the story! Stick with the pro's and you'll avoid the con's (unless they are one and the same),<br /><br /><br />Tom<br /> </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watching the Clock?]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/watching-the-clock]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/watching-the-clock#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 09:32:22 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/watching-the-clock</guid><description><![CDATA[Take heed of the E in ESIC!

Only early stage companies are eligible. You don't have time to wonder if that's fair or reasonable, you need to get cracking! The points are not going to fall into your lap, and without them you may struggle finding new investors. <br /><br />Why the rush? Well the chances are you have already set yourself a deadline, you incorporated and registered an ABN. The tests look at both of these dates, and so do we. We can use them to confirm how old the company is, and secondly to find out when you run out of time.<br /><br />If you have advanced your business via R&amp;D, Investment, Patent etc, you may well have sailed past the 3 year curfew, Do not despair! You can still qualify if the company was incorporated within the last 6 income tax years (the latest being the current income tax year at the test time).<br /><br />Say that again?<br /><br />Well the test time is a fancy way of saying the date of the share sale, so lets rephrase the tax speak to; your out of the action if you incorporated more than 6 tax years prior to the share sale.&nbsp; For example;<br /><br />INNOTECH incorporated on 1st of June 2012, applied for a patent that is granted in 2015, takes on 50k from a 3rd party investor and spends 50% of last years taxable income further R&amp;D. All sounding promising, though the clock is ticking! Tax year 1 is the 2011-2012 year, so 2016-17 will be the final year the company shares are&nbsp; eligible for a rebate! &nbsp;<br /><br />INNOTECH know how long it takes to on-board investors, confirm ESIC eligibility and wrap up all the paperwork, so the 9 months to 30 June 2017 is looking pretty skinny! <br /><br />What are you waiting for?<br /><br /><br />Tom<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Secret ingredients and the special sauce]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/secret-ingredients-and-the-special-sauce]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/secret-ingredients-and-the-special-sauce#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2016 10:05:26 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/secret-ingredients-and-the-special-sauce</guid><description><![CDATA[I may be quite odd, though it's not the first time I've pondered the fine line between lifting enough of the lid to show off the goodies to win someone over v's playing it cool (or too cool) and hiding behind confidentiality / commercial need to know principals.It gets even more interesting when considering the principals test, I mean just how new or significantly improved is your innovation if you don't have some special sauce to spice up the same old dish?Its a good reason the points test uses [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I may be quite odd, though it's not the first time I've pondered the fine line between lifting enough of the lid to show off the goodies to win someone over v's playing it cool (or too cool) and hiding behind confidentiality / commercial need to know principals.<br /><br />It gets even more interesting when considering the principals test, I mean just how new or significantly improved is your innovation if you don't have some special sauce to spice up the same old dish?<br /><br />Its a good reason the points test uses registered IP, so you've got it all out there and it's protected (technically at least). So what about the innovators with special sauce, deficient IP protection and the more subjective test to pass?<br /><br />I like the KFC analogy, you can talk about the famious 11 herbs and spices, fresh cooked chicken and so on, just be sure not to give away the recipe.<br /><br />It's an agonizing balancing act that every entreprenur must navigate in there own way, though we hope you find the right balance and ultimately investment that will help secure your business and the IP you are commercializing.<br /><br />Lastly, remember that virtually all IP is public knowledge sooner or later so you'd best make tracks fast.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Tom<br /><br />KFC recipe attached; http://www.food.com/recipe/11-secret-herbs-and-spices-kfc-copycat-133784<br /><br /> </div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Second Chance Draw?]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/second-chance-draw]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/second-chance-draw#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 09:20:43 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.esic.directory/all-about-innovation/second-chance-draw</guid><description><![CDATA[We had an interesting enquiry today that was refreshing and thought provoking.

So we set out&nbsp;to compile all&nbsp;that we could find out.&nbsp;<br /><br />Along the way&nbsp;lots of friends and founders found out what we&nbsp;were up to, so we had&nbsp;get them involved... 'what if we put together a listing'! Great idea, then&nbsp;we can get&nbsp;credit for all our hard work!<br /><br />We&nbsp;figured&nbsp;that any&nbsp;listing would be incomplete without referring to all the services and&nbsp;gateways&nbsp;people&nbsp;could used to get&nbsp;qualified.&nbsp;So now you can find not&nbsp;only&nbsp;ESIC's but also,&nbsp;Accelerators, Universities, R&amp;D partners and Advisors all in one place.<br /><br />Last but not least,&nbsp;we put&nbsp;together an online checklist to assist&nbsp;you guys in a&nbsp;form of self assessment.&nbsp;You might get straight&nbsp;through to a listing, or may need some help/clarification, though we hope you join us&nbsp;in the directory.<br /><br />We are already seeing heaps of&nbsp;visits to the site,&nbsp;including investor registrations!<br /><br />Thanks for visiting, and check in again soon! We've plenty of updates and improvements to come.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Tom<br />Email: <a href="mailto:tom@esic.directory">tom@esic.directory</a> </font><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
